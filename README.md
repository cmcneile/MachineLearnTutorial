Some basic Juypter notebooks used in a short course on Neural Networks.
These are hacks of existing notebooks on the Web. I have tried
to add questions to make them more into exercises.

The order I presented the tutorials is:

python_basic_one.ipynb : A very quick introduction to python.

mnist_tutorial.ipynb   : Recognition of hand written digits.

tensorflow_low_tutorial.ipynb : Looking at the low level parts of tensor flow.

IMDB_tutorial.ipynb : Classifyer of movie reviews

regression_tutorial.ipynb :  A simple regression example with a neural network.
