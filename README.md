Some basic Juypter notebooks used in a short course on Neural Networks.
These are actual hacks of existing notebooks on the Web. I have tried
to add questions to make them more into exercises.

The order I presented the material:

python_basic_one.ipynb : A very quick introduction to python.

mnist_tutorial.ipynb   :  

tensorflow_low_tutorial.ipynb

IMDB_tutorial.ipynb

regression_tutorial.ipynb
