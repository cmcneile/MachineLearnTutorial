Some basic Juypter notebooks used in a short course on Neural Networks.
These are hacks of existing notebooks on the Web. I have tried
to add questions to make them more into exercises.

Instructions.
-------------

1) Download the code from the github site. 

2) In the command window find the directory of the code. 

3) Unzip the file

4) Enter the directory and type
   jupyter-notebook 

This will start the jupter-notebook via the web page.

What is available
-----------------
The order I presented the tutorials was:

Monday
python_basic_one.ipynb : A very quick introduction to python.
mnist_tutorial.ipynb   : Recognition of hand written digits.

Friday
tensorflow_low_tutorial.ipynb : Looking at the low level parts of tensor flow.
IMDB_tutorial.ipynb : Classifyer of movie reviews
regression_tutorial.ipynb :  A simple regression example with a neural network.

                    of a neural network.
